        <h2>Three Mile Island accident</h2>
        <p>The Three Mile Island nuclear plant had two pressurized light-water reactors. On March 28, 1979, a cooling malfunction caused part of the core to melt in Reactor 2. Some radioactive gas was released but not enough to cause adverse health effects, as noted in numerous health studies. Reactor 2 was destroyed. The accident prompted additional safety measures and rigorous testing programs. Americaâ€™s nuclear power plants are safer now than ever because of the lessons learned.</p>
