        <h2>Women and Baseball</h2>
        <p>Although the idea of women playing sports in the 1940s was one that was hard for most Americans to fathom, they got their break when President Franklin Roosevelt mentioned the idea of women playing baseball to some of Philip Wrigleyâ€™s colleagues. The popularity continued into 1954 when it became difficult to find talented players to fill the teams. In the end, the league gave 600 women the opportunity to play professional baseball at the same level as the men did between 1943 and 1954. </p>

        <h2>The NFL</h2>
        <p>The NFLs goal in the 1950s was to gain experience and build a following considering there was the rise of television in the homes. The sport remained to be slightly profitable, but everything changed in 1958 when the championship game was broadcast on national television and is highly engaging.</p>

        <h2>The NBA</h2>
        <p>The NBAs 24 second shot was created by Syracuse Nationals owner Danny Biasone. Through the 50s the number of teams dwindled and with that fan support did as well. By the mid 50s only eight teams remained, but through the 24 second shot the sport saw a rise again because the sport became engaging.</p>
